&DESCRIBE here=Welcome to Character Generation for Shadow of Constantinople. This series of rooms will walk you through setting up your character and getting ready for play.  If you have any questions then be sure to ask on the Character Generation channel by using the following command:%R%R%T[ansi(hw,+cg <msg>)]%R%R%TCG uses a coloring format to help you through. Any text in [ansi(hy,yellow)] is a sheet attribute that you will set. Any text in [ansi(hw,white)] is a command that you can execute. Also note that when you see anything with < and > that you should not include the < and > when entering your response. This is simply a way to indicate that whatever is between < and > is a placeholder for where you would put some information.%R%TThanks for playing!

@parent here=#REPLACE
@set here = NO_COMMAND
&DESCRIBE here=In this room, you're going to put in some demographics that will describe your character. These aren't things that affect your sheet but they give staff a better idea of what your character is.%R%R%TFirst, your [ansi(hy,Concept)] should be a short sentence describing your character. This can be as simple as 'A punk rockstar' or as creative as 'A sanctified daeva ballerina.' It could even simply be your character type in the vein of 'Lancea Sanctum Mekhet.'%R%TSecond, your [ansi(hy,Full Name)] is simply your full name. The last and first name you have.%R%TThird, your [ansi(hy,Birthday)] is when your character was born. We prefer that this be entered in the format Month Day Year. Whether you do that by using the numbers as in 7/1/12 or by writing it out is up to you.%R%TFourth, we'll ask for an [ansi(hy,email)]. Rest assured that this email is only used and seen by staff. We will not send you unannounced emails, but email is an effective way to track alts and to verify ownership of a character if you ever forget your password.%R%TTo set these items, use the following commands.%R%R%T[ansi(hw,+concept <text>)] - set your concept to <text>%R%T[ansi(hw,+fullname <text>)] - Set your full name to <text>%R%T[ansi(hw,+birthday <text>)] - Set your birthday to <text>%R%T[ansi(hw,+email <text>)] - Set your email to <text>

@dig/teleport CG - Attributes=Attributes;N,Demographics;O
@parent here=#REPLACE
@set here = NO_COMMAND
&DESCRIBE here=In this room you'll set your attributes and select priorities. Remember that New World of Darkness uses an attribute spread of [ansi(hy,9 Primary)], [ansi(hy,5 Secondary)] and [ansi(hy,3 Tertiary)]. Attributes are the biggest part of your character, sometimes more so than skills, because they also affect derived statistics.%R%R%TFirst, pick your [ansi(hy,Priorities)]. This determines how many points you get in your Social, Physical or Mental attributes.%R%TIf you want to know what attributes fall under these categories then you use [ansi(hw,+stat/list)]. Typing this will give you a list of stat categories you can get a list for. Three of these are Physical-Attributes, Social-Attributes and Mental-Attributes. If you want to see which attributes belong to the physical category you can type [ansi(hw,+stat/list Physical-Attributes)]. You can replace Physical-Attributes with any other stat type as listed for a listing of all stats of that type.%R%TSecond, you need to assign those points to your Attributes. Each attribute starts at 1. So assign a number of points equal to the number that category got based on your priority choices.%R%R%TThe commands to do these things are:%R%T[ansi(hw,+priorities XYZ)] - Set your priorities to XYZ. Only use the first letter. So Physical Mental Social would be PMS.%R%T[ansi(hw,+stat <attribute>=<level>)] - Set <attribute> to <level>. Attribute can be partial. The first matched attribute is what it sets.%R%T[ansi(hw,+bulkstat <attribute>=<level>|<attribute>=<level>)] - Set multiple attributes at once. Each entry in the list is evaluated and the given <attribute> is set to <level>. These items should be delimited by |.%R%T[ansi(hw,+sheet)] - To review you current choices.

&DESCRIBE here=In this room, you'll set your initial skills. Remember that these skills are not meant to represent everything your character can do. It is expected that everyone with a driver's license can drive a car, the drive skill however is meant to represent a person who is better at driving a car than your average person. When making skill choices, remember this and know that you should be putting your points in the skills that your character performs better than their peers.%R%R%TNew World of Darkness uses a skill point distribution of [ansi(hy,13 Primary)], [ansi(hy,9 Secondary)] and [ansi(hy,5 Tertiary)]. Remember that you can see what skills are in each category by using [ansi(hw,+stat/list)].%R%R%TFirst, you'll need to set your priorities.%R%TSecond, you'll need to distribute your skill points to your various categories of skills.%R%TThird, you'll need to select your free specialties. You get 3 of them.%R%R%T[ansi(hw,+priorities XYZ)] - Set your priorities to XYZ. Only use the first letter. So Physical Mental Social would be PMS.%R%T[ansi(hw,+stat <skill>=<level>)] - Set <attribute> to <level>. Attribute can be partial. The first matched attribute is what it sets.%R%T[ansi(hw,+bulkstat <skill>=<level>|<skill>=<level>)] - Set multiple attributes at once. Each entry in the list is evaluated and the given <attribute> is set to <level>. These items should be delimited by |.%R%T[ansi(hw,+spec <skill>=<specialty name>)] - Add a specialty called <specialty name> to <skill>.%R%T[ansi(hw,+sheet)] - To review your current selections.
