@	Purpose: Patches the Universal Inventory System to allow a voucher like system.
@----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@	Layout:
@		On Database:
@			VOUCHER ID: Player DBREF that currently owns it
@
@		On Voucher:
@			INVITEMS: ID:AMT|ID:AMT| etc same as inventory system
@
@		On Voucher Parent:
@			Globals: Includes some format parents. Look, describe parents etc.
@
@	Commands:
@	   Staff:
@			+voucher/create id:amt id:amt id:amt etc - create a new voucher with the given item ID's and amounts. Will error out if any invalid ID's exist. amt is optional, defaults to 1.
@			+voucher/delete id=reason - delete the voucher at ID and remove it from the player's inventory. This outputs a message to that player as well.
@									   reason is optional but outputs in addition to the base 'Voucher has been destroyed' that goes to the player.
@			+voucher/edit id=item id:amt - individually remove items from a voucher. Staff only, allows remote management of voucher inventories.
@			+voucher - shows a list of all current vouchers
@			+voucher ID - shows details on a voucher. Who owns it and what's in it.
@
@	   Player:
@			+voucher/trans ID=Player/reason - Player/staff command to transfer vouchers between players. Once a player has a voucher, it can be freely transferred. Reason required. Tracked.
