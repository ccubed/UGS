Universal Game System

---------------------

1)	What is this?

	This is a collection of softcode that is meant to help setup a game and make it immediately playable.
	
2)	What is available?

	At the moment, there are four types of code available.
	Dice rollers, A universal CG System, A universal sheet system
	and a universal inventory system.
	
3)	Where can I find more information about each system?

	In each folder is a readme specifically tailored to each set of softcode.

4)	Will you add X system or do Y?

	Maybe, Maybe not. If you want to do it then you certainly can. If you want to add dropins,
	then I would appreciate if you would let me know you did so. If you use github, asking to
	pull it into the main repository would be even better. That way everyone can have access
	to the new system.
